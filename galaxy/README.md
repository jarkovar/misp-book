## Galaxies

Galaxies in MISP are a method used to express a large object called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or attributes. A cluster can be composed of one or more elements. Elements are expressed as key-values.

There are default vocabularies available in MISP galaxy but those can be overwritten, replaced or updated as you wish. Vocabularies are from existing standards (like STIX, Veris, MISP and so on) or custom ones.

Existing clusters and vocabularies can be used as-is or as a template. MISP distribution can be applied to each cluster to permit a limited or broader distribution scheme.

The objective is to have a common set of clusters for organizations starting analysis but that can be expanded to localized information (which is not shared) or additional information (that can be shared).

[MISP galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) are available on Github.

### Managing Galaxies in MISP

> [warning] You need to have a specific role to manage Galaxies on a MISP instance.

Galaxies management is accessed using the Galaxies link on the top menu.

![MenuGalaxy](./figures/GalaxyMenu.png)

A list with all the galaxies existing on the server will appear.

![GalaxyView](./figures/GalaxyView.png)

Each galaxy can be explored using the icon at the end of the line.

![GalaxyList](./figures/GalaxyList.png)

Here is shown the metadata of the selected galaxy as well as a table with each available value as well as some complementary data such as a description of the value or the activity, that is to say the evolution of the use of each value.

Galaxies can be reimported from the submodules by clicking the "Update Galaxies" link on either the galaxies list or while browsing a specific galaxy. A popup will appear to confirm the reimportation.

![GalaxyUpdate](./figures/GalaxyUpdate.png)

All galaxies will always be updated, even while browsing a specific galaxy.

### Using Galaxies in MISP Events - Example

For this example, we will try to add a cluster to an existing event. This cluster will contains informations about threat actor known as Sneaky Panda.

![EventWithoutCluster](./figures/EventWithoutCluster.png)

Here on the event view, we notice a blue frame under the metadatas with the title "Galaxies" and a button "Add new cluster". Let's click on the latter to begin.

![GalaxyPopup](./figures/GalaxyPopup.png)

A popup will appear proposing to explore a particular galaxy or all at the same time. Here, as we know we want to as a threat actor, we will choose the second option and scroll to find Sneaky Panda (We are courageous, aren't we?).

![NoSneakyPanda](./figures/NoSneakyPanda.png)

Wait. No Sneaky Panda? Hm that's strange. Or maybe it is only registred as an alias. Let's have a look! To do so we will use the search field which stay on top of the list. So what do we get? Beijing Group, is it an alias of our threat actor.

![Search](./figures/Search.png)

Pointing the cursor on it will give us the answer.

![Alias](./figures/Alias.png)

We have a match. So we select it and here we go.

![NewThreatActor](./figures/NewThreatActor.png)

Clicking on the magnifying glass next to Threat actor redirects to the list of all threat actors
Clicking on the magnifying glass next to Beijing Group redirects us to a page about this group
Clicking on the addition symbol on the left of Beijing Group extends the module.
